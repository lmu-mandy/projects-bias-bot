<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00"><b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">US Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson has told senators she will be independent and apply the law "without fear or favour". </b></p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">She made the remarks on Monday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the panel that will advance or sink her nomination.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">If successful, she will be considered by the full Senate as a replacement for retiring Justice Stephen Breyer.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Recent Supreme Court nominations have drawn partisan rancour in the chamber.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">If confirmed, Judge Jackson, 51, will be the first black woman justice named to the highest US court. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Announcing her nomination last month, US President Joe Biden, a Democrat, called her "one of the nation's brightest legal minds". It was long past time that a black woman be confirmed to sit on the 233-year-old US Supreme Court, he suggested.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The court plays a key role in American life and is often the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">For any Supreme Court justice nomination, the president first chooses his preferred candidate and the Senate then votes to confirm that nominee, which requires a simple majority.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The Senate is currently split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, and Vice-President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, gets the deciding vote in the event of a tie.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The Biden administration has indicated it hopes to garner some Republican backing.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">While civil rights and liberal advocacy groups have queued up to support the nomination, conservatives say they will closely scrutinise Judge Jackson's judicial philosophy, or how she views and interprets the law. Of particular interest will be her time as a public defender and as vice-chair of the US Sentencing Commission.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">In her opening remarks before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday, Judge Jackson spoke of her family and her legal mentors and role models. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">She clerked for Justice Breyer during the Supreme Court's 1999-2000 term and said the retiring justice exemplified what was needed in the role, the "highest level of skill and integrity, civility, and grace".</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Judge Jackson also briefly spoke of her approach to law, saying: "I have been a judge for nearly a decade now, and I take that responsibility and my duty to be independent very seriously.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"I decide cases from a neutral posture. I evaluate the facts, and I interpret and apply the law to the facts of the case before me, without fear or favour, consistent with my judicial oath. "</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Chuck Grassley, the committee's top Republican, on Monday promised Judge Jackson a respectful process but said his colleagues would be looking into whether she has imposed her own policy preferences from the bench, which "makes it harder for us to write good laws", he said.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"I'll be looking to see whether Judge Jackson is committed to the Constitution as originally understood," Mr Grassley said.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Democrats are expected to lean heavily on the historic nature of Judge Jackson's selection.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"Your presence here to brave this process will give inspiration to millions who see themselves in you," said Democratic committee chairman Dick Durbin, calling her a "living witness" of what is possible in America.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Her backers will also argue that her resume gives her an informed perspective of the US criminal justice system.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The Washington DC native will not shift the court's current 6-3 conservative majority if she is confirmed. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">She currently serves on the influential US Court of Appeals for the DC circuit. Three current Supreme Court justices previously presided on that court.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The jurist has two degrees from Harvard University and once served as editor of the Harvard Law Review.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Mr Biden first promised to nominate a black woman to the top court two years ago while campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Black women make up about 3% of the federal judiciary, according to data from the Federal Judicial Center, the court system's research arm.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">If confirmed, Judge Jackson would only be the third black American to sit on the US Supreme Court, after justices Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Thomas. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Mr Thomas, 73, is the longest-serving Supreme Court associate justice. It emerged on Sunday that he is currently in hospital with an infection, but continues to work in absentia.</p>
