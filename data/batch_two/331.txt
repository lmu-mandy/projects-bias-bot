<p class="speakable">A New York City landlord has publicly shamed his tenants for not paying rent after they accrued $17,000 in back rent, according to a local report.</p>
<p class="speakable">Calvin and Jean Thompson hung banners that read "MY TENANTS ON THE FIRST FLOOR ARE NOT PAYING RENT" above the first-floor rental in Queens, the New York Post reported. The enormous banners can be seen from the Belt Parkway.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"It’s uncomfortable that we have to hang these up, but we’re $20,000 uncomfortable, so I think a sign is very minor," the Thompsons’ son, Calvin Jr., told the paper.</p>
<p>The Thompsons told the paper that after they raised the rent $100 from $1,800 to $1,900 – the first hike in 9 years – the tenants refused to pay the new amount. </p>

<p>The tenants told the paper that they tried to drop off $1,800 in rent instead of the new amount, but the Thompsons refused to take it. They said that’s when they stopped paying rent.</p>
<p>"I don’t think a $100 increase for almost a decade of living is unreasonable," Calvin Jr. said. "There are plenty of landlords in our situation because of COVID. A lot of eviction cases are backlogged. She knows this and is going to ride this out."</p>
<p>New York's eviction moratorium expired in January. Individuals who applied for rental assistance have eviction protection while their applications are reviewed. But housing advocates say such protections won't last forever.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are nearly 20,000 eviction cases pending in New York City alone, according to the Post.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, The New York State Assembly and Senate have proposed adding at least $1 billion in funding to New York's Emergency Rental Assistance Program, which has run out of money.</p>
