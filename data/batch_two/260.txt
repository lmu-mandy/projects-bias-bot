<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">One worshipper knocked the axe from the man's hands, and held him down until police arrived, local media reports.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">A 24-year-old man was arrested at the scene in the suburb of Mississauga, and he has since been charged.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Some congregants had minor injures from the bear spray, the mosque's imam said.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">One of the worshippers said the experience was "terrifying" and described hearing a scream before turning around to see a man holding an axe and using bear spray - similar to pepper spray - against three people.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"By the time he was spraying, the people in the first row realized something was going on and one of the young men turned around and knocked away the axe before he had a chance to use it," Noorani Sairally told Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The young man then held the alleged assailant down until police arrived, the witness said.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"Before he could inflict harm on any worshippers, several congregants bravely were able to stop him in his tracks," imam Ibrahim Hindy said in a statement, describing the moment the attacker entered the site.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"Our community will never be broken and we refuse to be intimated," he added.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Police have named the man they arrested as Mohammad Moiz Omar, and charged him with six offences including assault with a weapon and administering a noxious substance with intent to endanger life or cause bodily harm.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Following initial uncertainty over a possible motive, investigators now say they believe the attack was a "hate-motivated incident."</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was one of a number of high-profile Canadian public figures to condemn the attack, which he described as "incredibly disturbing" and applauded the courage of the worshippers at the mosque.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Canada's Muslim community has been targeted in a number of deadly attacks, including in 2017 when a shooting at a Quebec City mosque killed six people and left another eight wounded.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">And last year, four members of the same Muslim family were killed after a vehicle hit them in London, Ontario, which was described by police as a deliberate Islamophobic attack.</p>
