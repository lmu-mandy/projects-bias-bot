<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Tanner Brass was found dead hours after police arrested his mother, Kyla Frenchman, when she argued with them about her son's safety, she said. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The boy's father, Kaij Brass, has been charged with second-degree murder.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Indigenous leaders say Ms Frenchman was racially profiled and have demanded the local police chief's resignation.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Two Canadian police officers in the city of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, have been suspended.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Police responded to reports of a domestic dispute in the early hours of 10 February and found Ms Frenchman standing outside the apartment building, she said. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Ms Frenchman told the officers she had been kicked out of her apartment and feared her 13-month-old son was in danger.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">She said the officers told her to wait outside and entered the building, only to return shortly afterwards and say no-one had answered the door.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Ms Frenchman said when she demanded the officers check on Tanner, she was arrested for suspected intoxication. She denies being drunk.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Several hours later police were called back to the same home to reports of a homicide involving a child.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">They found Tanner dead and Kaij Brass was arrested. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Speaking at a news conference on Friday, Kyla Frenchman struggled to speak as she demanded justice for her son. Standing with friends and relatives, she spoke of her son as a "happy baby" with a big smile. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">A statement read on her behalf said she had "begged and pleaded" with police to help her and her child after they arrived at their home.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">It went on: "Instead, they accused me of being drunk. They put me in handcuffs and they put me in a cell." </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">A statement from the Prince Albert police department described the boy's death as a tragedy.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">It added: "As an organisation, there is nothing we can say to lessen the grief and torment at this shocking loss of a deeply loved child from our community."</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">But Heather Bear, Vice-Chief of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, said: "If these officers showed up to a domestic dispute call involving a young white family, knowing that an infant was inside and possibly in danger, do you think they would have arrested the mother and left?"</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Police have not responded to this allegation.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Earlier this month, the department's chief, Jon Bergen, suspended the two officers involved with pay. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Last week, 95% of the union representing Prince Albert officers supported a vote of no confidence in Mr Bergen's leadership. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Ms Frenchman said in her statement she believed Tanner would still be alive "if they had listened to me".</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">An investigation into the boy's death is ongoing.</p>
