<p class="speakable">Authorities in Arkansas late Saturday doubled the number of victims at a car-show shooting in Dumas, saying as many as 20 people had been wounded by gunfire after initially estimating there were about 10 victims, according to reports.</p>
<p class="speakable">The number of people killed remained at one, the reports said.</p>
<p>The car show was part of the 16th annual "Hood-Nic" event to promote nonviolence, FOX 16 of Little Rock reported.</p>
<p>At least several of those wounded were children but Dumas police Chief Keith Finch said he was told the children were doing OK afterward, reporter Shelby Rose of KATV-TV in Little Rock wrote on Twitter.</p>
<p>At least one suspect was taken into custody in connection with the gunfire, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But authorities believe other suspects remained at large, Finch told MonticelloLive.com.</p>
<p>"Multiple gunmen just started shooting," shortly before 7 p.m. in the parking lot of the former Fred's Dollar Store, the chief told the outlet.</p>
<p>The incident was believed to be among the worst shootings in Arkansas history, rivaling the Power Ultra Lounge shooting in 2017 that left 25 people shot, according to reporter Andrew Epperson of Little Rock's KARK-TV.</p>
