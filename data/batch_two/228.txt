<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00"><b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Russia's space agency has rejected claims that three Russian cosmonauts boarded the International Space Station wearing Ukrainian colours, in a possible statement against the war.</b></p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The first arrivals since Russia's war began were shown wearing bright yellow suits with blue trimmings.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">They were warmly welcomed on board, hugging and greeting their fellow American, Russian and German crew.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"Sometimes yellow is just yellow," said the Roscosmos space agency.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The ISS is a joint project between Russia, America, Canada, Japan and several European countries.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">It is led by a US-Russian partnership that has continued for two decades despite fluctuating tensions between the two world powers.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Russian cosmonauts Denis Matveyev, Oleg Artemyev and Sergey Korsakov docked at the ISS after a three-hour flight which blasted off from a Russian-owned facility in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"Congratulations on the successful docking," a voice from Russia's mission control said.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">A few hours later, two sets of hatches were opened and the three smiling men floated into the space station one by one in their yellow suits.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The standard-issue Russian uniform is plain blue, and at least one of the men was seen wearing this before take-off.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The moment was live-streamed by both Roscosmos and Nasa, the American space agency.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"It became our turn to pick a colour," Mr Artemyev said when he was asked about the suits in a live-streamed press conference.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"We had accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it," he joked. "That's why we had to wear yellow."</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Since the invasion of Ukraine, people around the world have used the colours of its national flag to show solidarity and support.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">But Roscosmos's press service dismissed the reports as a "funny invention" by foreign bloggers and media.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"The flight suits of the new crew are made in the colours of the emblem of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University, which all three cosmonauts graduated from... To see the Ukrainian flag everywhere and in everything is crazy."</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The head of Roscosmos, Dmitry Rogozin, is a strong supporter of the invasion and he suggested the claims that the cosmonauts were wearing Ukrainian colours had come from Ukrainian nationalists.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Roscosmos later published another picture of Oleg Artemyev wearing an obviously Russian suit.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The three Russians will begin a science mission on the ISS that is set to last just over six months.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">They will replace three current crew members who are scheduled to fly back to Earth on 30 March.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The colours certainly speak to the moment, but what is the real motivation in wearing them? Does it signal support for Ukraine or the opposite? After all, the suits do display Russian flags. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Perhaps neither view is correct. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">It has been suggested that the colours are a reflection of the fact that all three cosmonauts attended the Bauman Moscow State Technical University which has a similar colour scheme.  It's a "Bauman crew", the university has been trumpeting. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The cosmonauts themselves, however, said noticeably little.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">What we do know is that 400km (248 miles) above the Earth, East and West have no choice but to continue friendly relations. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">While space co-operation is falling apart elsewhere - witness the ExoMars rover, for example - on the ISS the partners are joined at the hip. Russia provides the propulsion for the station, the Americans provide the power. The ISS cannot exist without either party. </p>
