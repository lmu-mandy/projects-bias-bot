<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Last week the former Empire star, 39, was found guilty of lying to police and sentenced to 150 days in prison.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Following his sentencing, his lawyers launched an appeal.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Smollett has always maintained the hoax incident, which took place in Chicago in 2019, was real.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">He had to sign a $150,000 (Â£114,000) recognizance bond prior to his release and made no comment as he left Cook County jail surrounded by security.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">But his defence team said they were "very, very happy" with the appeal justices' ruling and said Smollett was the target of a racist justice system, CBS News reports.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">His team argued his imprisonment - for what was described as a low-level, non-violent crime - was excessive and that his health and safety were in danger while he remained in prison. They also questioned why he had been imprisoned after a previous prosecutor dropped the charges against him in 2019.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"Regardless of what you think about this case... the real question is, should black men be walked into jail for a Class 4 felony? Shame on you if you think they should, that's a disgrace," his defence attorney Nenye Uche is quoted as saying in The Chicago Tribune.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The prosecuting office said the claim that his health and safety were at risk was incorrect as he had been in protective custody while in prison.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The ruling stemmed from an incident three years ago when Smollett said he was attacked by two assailants.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The actor, who is black and gay, said the attackers had shouted slurs and a Trump slogan, dumped a "chemical substance" on him and tied a noose around his neck while he was walking late at night in January 2019.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Police opened an investigation into the incident but later charged Smollett with filing a false police report, saying he had staged the assault.</p>
