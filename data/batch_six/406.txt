<p>Taherzadeh was also allegedly seen in a video obtained by law enforcement "shooting a handgun and assault rifle at a shooting range" which is believed to be in Northern Virginia. In one of the videos, prosecutors allege that he is wearing a long sleeve shirt with 'U.S. Secret Service" displayed on it. Taherzadeh is prohibited from possessing these weapons, according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>During a voluntary interview after Taherzadeh was arrested he admitted to falsely identifying himself as a Department of Homeland Security member as well as a former United States Army Ranger. He also said that he provided free apartments to two Secret Service agents for one year, in addition to providing multiple other gifts to members of the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Taherzdeh also admitted to deleting social media content that was law enforcement-related after realizing there was a federal investigation into the two men's activity, according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>Prosecutors are requesting that the two men be detained prior to their trial, arguing that Ali is a flight risk and Taherzdeh could attempt to obstruct justice.</p>
<p>A detention hearing will take place on Friday for both men.</p>
<p>The plotwo individuals' plot began unravel when a United States Postal Inspector arrived at their apartment complex to investigate an alleged assault which involved a United States Postal Service carrier, according to prosecutors. </p>
<p>The men identified themselves as investigators with the U.S. Special Police Investigation Unit, which Ali said was part of the Department of Homeland Security, and said Taherzadeh was a Department of Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent.</p>
<p>The United States Postal Inspector then gave this information to the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General, where it was then referred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to a court filing.</p>
<p>In an attempt to prove he was an employee of the Department of Homeland Security, Taherzadeh took a picture of himself in a Department of Homeland Security Investigations "vest." The Secret Service agent investigating the two suspects also allegedly saw multiple pictures of Taherzadeh in police tactical gear, according to prosecutors.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Taherzadeh also allegedly texted the Secret Service agent a picture which he said was purportedly from a training, but was actually pulled from a social media post.</span> <span>(Department of Justice)</span></p>

<p>Federal prosecutors allege that Taherzadeh identified himself as a Department of Homeland Security Investigations special agent to a Secret Service agent who's currently assigned to the first lady's protection detail, and Ali identified himself as a Homeland Security Investigations analyst.</p>
<p>Fox News has confirmed that of the four Secret Service agents suspended in connection with the investigation, two of them worked for the uniformed division, and one of the agents' duties was in the vicinity of the residence of Vice President Harris, but not on her person detail.</p>
<p>A separate Secret Service agent who is now suspended was assigned to the Presidential Protective Division of First lady Jill Biden, and sources tell Fox News that it's possible this agent filled in for agents close to President Biden at times but was not on the president's regular security detail.</p>
<p>Residents of the luxury apartment complex in Navy Yard told the inspector that the two men set up video surveillance throughout the apartment complex, and said they believe that they had access to personal information, and even said that the men claimed they could access residents' cell phones.</p>

<p>One witness, who is a member of the Secret Service, said that Taherzadeh had access to "all floors of the apartment," including some restricted areas. The witness says that Taherzadeh was able to get this access by speaking with the apartment complex's management and identifying himself as a federal agent.</p>
<p>Taherzadeh allegedly controls a limited liability company titled "United Special Police LLC," which is described as a private law enforcement, investigative, and protective service based in Washington, D.C.</p>
