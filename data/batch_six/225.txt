<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Thousands of people heading on their first trip abroad since coronavirus restrictions ended have been met with long queues, delays, and in some cases, cancelled flights.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Some airports and airlines have been struggling as passenger numbers gradually return to pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">And industry leaders have warned the situation isn't going to improve for some time yet.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Manchester Airport appears to have been the worst hit after issues developed last weekend, while Heathrow, Gatwick and Birmingham have also been affected by delays and cancellations.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Travellers at Manchester Airport described scenes of "chaos" after several missed their flights, amid warnings that emergency services staff could be drafted in to help tackle the problems.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The disruption led to the airport's managing director Karen Smart announcing that she would stand down.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Donna Mayfield queued for three hours at Manchester Airport but still missed her flight to Spain to see her 83-year-old mother for the first time since lockdowns began.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">She said the situation was "horrendous", while another traveller said they saw "customers and staff in tears".</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Former Monarch Airlines boss Tim Jeans, who is now director of Cornwall Airport Newquay, told the BBC's Today programme it appeared Manchester Airport didn't have correct plans in place to recruit and train staff in advance.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Passengers at Birmingham Airport also complained of long queues for those both arriving and departing. The airport apologised and said standards had not been met.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">As Covid led to the government imposing lockdowns and travel restrictions, airport operations across the world shut down with fleets of planes grounded.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The furlough scheme helped, but couldn't fully shield the aviation industry from the devastating impact, with thousands of job losses across airlines and airports. British Airways shed more than 10,000 jobs, while EasyJet closed its bases at Stansted, Southend and Newcastle, with the loss of 670 roles.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Amid the job uncertainty some workers opted for career changes.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Yet as borders reopened and demand for flights returned, the industry has found it difficult to recruit new staff quickly enough.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Reasons for the weakened workforce is due to a "combination of a very tight labour market, delays in the necessary government security checks for new and returning staff, as well as Covid-related staff absences," according to the Airport Operators Association (AOA), which represents most UK airports ranging from Heathrow to Edinburgh.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">One Resourcing, a specialist aviation and airport recruitment company, told the BBC that finding enough ground staff, including cleaners and baggage handlers, was proving very challenging. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Its boss Kevin O'Reilly said some other jobs were tempting workers away and some European Union nationals had left after Brexit.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"It's always been a tough market to recruit for, but it's become harder this year," he said.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"Recruitment at airports doesn't happen overnight, people must go through a thorough security vetting process to get an airside pass," he added.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Meanwhile, Cornwall Airport Newquay boss Mr Jeans said it takes on average at least 12 weeks to recruit and train new security staff.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">But staff shortages aren't the only issue airports highlighted as a cause of queues.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Covid documents are still required by many countries, which has prolonged check-in times, and rather ironically, when people turn up too early, that only adds to queues.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">John Strickland, director of transport consultancy JLS Consulting, has said the situation for airlines was going to be "very difficult" over the next couple of months. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Karen Dee, chief executive of the AOA, said at peak time passengers "may not have the experience they are used to".</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">She said airports were working hard to recruit more staff in the run-up to the Easter holidays, and were "working with the UK government to resolve any delays in the necessary checks before staff can start work".</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Britain's biggest airport Heathrow has said peak demand over the summer holidays could reach 85% of pre-pandemic levels and raised concerns about capacity.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Elsewhere, Edinburgh Airport has also warned holidaymakers to expect queues and disruption over the summer as it returns to full service.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">And it's not just UK airports being hit by delays - Dublin Airport has advised travellers to arrive three-and-a-half hours before their flight due to similar issues.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">A number of well-known airlines, including EasyJet and British Airways have cancelled flights weeks in advance, however, in the run up to Easter, there have been a few services grounded at the last minute.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Package holiday operators appear less affected. For example, Jet2 is reporting its schedule is operating as planned.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">EasyJet has blamed hundreds of its cancellations on Covid-related staff absences, with cabin crew and pilots among those out of action.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Meanwhile, BA has axed fewer flights at short notice due to Covid. But it took the decision two weeks ago to thin out its April and May schedules to ease some of the pressure.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">BA has had other issues too. It has had several IT meltdowns in recent weeks which have caused delays to journeys and its Moscow flights are suspended as a result of the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The resumption of some long-haul routes has also been delayed because of the Covid situation in other parts of the world.</p>
