<div><h1 class="pg-headline">College admissions scam's test-taking ace sentenced, former USC coach found guilty</h1><p class="zn-body__paragraph speakable"><cite class="el-editorial-source"> (CNN)</cite>A key figure in the sprawling college admissions scam was sentenced to four months in prison Friday -- the same day a former University of Southern California water polo coach was found guilty of conspiracy and fraud.</p>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Mark Riddell, 39, who helped wealthy parents buy their children's way into universities, was also sentenced to two years of supervised release after his prison sentence. He was ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and submit to $239,449 in forfeiture, according to Caroline Ferguson, a spokeswoman for the US Attorney's Office for Massachusetts. </div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Before the sentencing, former USC water polo coach Jovan Vavic was found guilty of conspiracy and fraud for soliciting and accepting bribes to facilitate admissions of students in the scam. </div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Riddell, a standardized test-taking savant, was paid to either ace SATs and ACTs in students' place, or correct the students' answers before they were handed in, prosecutors said.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">CNN has reached out to Riddell's attorney for comment. </div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Riddell, one of many people caught up in the wider scheme in 2019, pleaded guilty that year to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Authorities arrested and charged Riddell, dozens of parents, college coaches and administrators in the sprawling 2019 investigation known as "Operation Varsity Blues." </div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Riddell agreed to a plea deal in 2019 that calls for incarceration at the low end of sentencing guidelines for the charges. Federal prosecutors have suggested a 33- to 41-month sentence, a law enforcement source told CNN that year. He had faced up to 20 years in prison.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Prosecutors have said Riddell was associated with William "Rick" Singer, a former college admissions coach who masterminded the scam.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Singer, prosecutors said, ran two general scams: First, to cheat on standardized tests for students whose parents paid; and second, to use Singer's connections with college sports coaches and use bribes to get paying parents' kids into school with fake athletic credentials.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Riddell was a key player in the testing scam, prosecutors said.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">For years starting in 2011, Singer, the owner of a college prep business, bribed test administrators to let Riddell take tests in students' place or correct students' answers, prosecutors said. Singer would funnel money from a bogus charity, to which his clients donated, to test administrators at a Los Angeles private school and a public high school in Houston, authorities said. </div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Riddell was paid $10,000 per test, prosecutors said.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">"He was just a really smart guy," Andrew Lelling, US Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said at a March 2019 news conference. "He didn't have any side information about the correct answers. He was just smart enough to get a near-perfect score on the exam or to calibrate the score."</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Singer, who aided the investigation, pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other charges, and is awaiting sentencing.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>'One of the largest scandals in the history of academia'</h3></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">US Attorney for Massachusetts Rachael Rollins said her office is "grateful" for the verdict in the Vavic case, part of what she called "arguably one of the largest scandals in the history of academia."</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">"To say that the conduct in this case was reprehensible is an understatement," Rollins said at a press conference. "The rich, powerful and famous, dripping with privilege and entitlement, used their money and clout to steal college admissions spots from more qualified and deserving students."</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Vavic accepted bribes from Singer.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Vavic was accused of designating certain USC applicants as water polo recruits, thereby facilitating their admission to the university, by relying on fake athletic resumes, in exchange for bribes. He was fired in March 2019 after his allegations of his involvement in the scam were made public.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>Most people charged in 'Operation Varsity Blues' investigation have pleaded guilty</h3></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">The vast majority of those charged have pleaded guilty and served out their sentences, generally measured in weeks or months.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Among the more high-profile parents charged in the test-taking portion of the scheme was actress Felicity Huffman, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud for paying $15,000 to the Singer to boost her older daughter's test scores. Huffman spent 11 days in jail in 2019.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Another actress, Lori Loughlin, spent two months in prison and her husband Mossimo Giannulli spent five months in prison for paying $500,000 to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as fake recruited athletes.</div>
