<p>The drunken driver shown in the video was speeding toward the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, where thousands of runners were participating in the Skyway 10K to raise money for military families.</p>

<p>Schuck is seen turning her patrol vehicle directly into the path of the drunk driver and then the two vehicles crash head-on.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your bravery and self-sacrifice, Trooper Schuck," the FHP said. "We wish you a speedy recovery."</p>

<p>She told a judge she is unemployed and is living off money from a lawsuit, the news outlet reported. As she faced multiple charges, including DUI, she laughed. </p>
<p>"Would you have any trouble coming to court?" asked the public defender. </p>
<p>"Considering I don't have a car. I'll have to fix that, I guess," she replied. </p>
