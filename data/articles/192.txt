<p>According to Des Moines Police, officers arrived at the scene and discovered three teenagers – a 15-year-old boy and two girls, ages 16 and 18 – wounded near a parking lot. All three were rushed to a local hospital, but the boy could not be saved. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Investigators determined that the boy was the shooters’ intended target, while the teen girls were merely innocent bystanders, police said. A motive was not immediately released. Both surviving teenagers remained hospitalized Tuesday with life-threatening injuries.</p>
<p>"While this incident occurred outside of a school, it could have occurred in any one of our neighborhoods," DMPD said. "The school is where the suspects found their target."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Police were able to track down their six suspects within hours, and investigators executed several search warrants at associated homes and vehicles. They ultimately recovered multiple guns, cops said. </p>
