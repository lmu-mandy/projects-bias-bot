<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00"><b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">It most definitely wasn't a "normal" evening on Friday in West Hollywood. There were more than 100 people at a venue popular among celebrities, and everyone was singing in Welsh, at the top of their lungs.</b></p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00"><b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">And if you asked me two years ago whether it was possible to fill a swanky cocktail bar in Los Angeles full of figures from sports, business and creative industries, to come together to celebrate Wales, I would have said 'no way'. </b></p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00"><b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">But then came </b>Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">.</b></p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">It was actor and comedian Humphrey Ker who had the idea to buy a football club, and he quickly persuaded Rob and Ryan to jump on board. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Humphrey searched far and wide for a club, until the three finally set their sights on Wrexham AFC. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">These days, when any of the three are asked 'why Wrexham?' they always respond 'why not Wrexham?'</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">And it is this affirmative and ambitious attitude they share for the world's third oldest football club that has propelled Wrexham to increased success over the last 12 months, with play-offs now very much on the horizon. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">They quickly brought on board Fleur Robinson as chief executive officer. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Fleur had helped take Burton Albion from non-league football to two seasons in the second tier championship. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">And together, their ethos has been clear: to help grow the club at home and abroad, while protecting the deep cultural heritage of Wrexham. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">What they perhaps didn't foresee is that the story would become much bigger than Wrexham, and would quickly extend to Wales and the Welsh language. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Rob and Ryan have become unofficial ambassadors to Wales, a role that Rob says he didn't expect, but is most definitely embracing.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"A year ago I don't think either of us would have guessed this would happen, but we fully accept the responsibility with great honour," he says. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The <i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Welcome to Wrexham</i> documentary team, who are unveiling a series on FX later this year, is capturing the entire journey. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">When I recorded the promo to announce the show, it became very clear to me that both Rob and Ryan had a deep respect for the Welsh language. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">They chose to include Welsh in the promo, and it was immediately noticeable to me when I first met the guys, that their investment in Welsh sport and culture is genuine. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Fast-forward a year, and my experience as a Welsh person living in the US has changed immensely. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">A year ago I found myself constantly explaining where Wales is, and that Welsh is a different language, I am now often greeted by "oh Wales, as in Wrexham" when I first meet Americans. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Rob, particularly, has really thrown himself into being an honorary Welshman, and is consistently surprising the Welsh speaking community with his language skills. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"It's a really difficult language to learn," says Rob.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"But I hope to keep going and one day speak it fluently enough to be able to tell jokes in Welsh."</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Every year, the Welsh government in North America holds events to celebrate St David's Day. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">They are often held on the east coast, where there is a larger number of Welsh diaspora, so it was exciting to hear that this year, the government was to hold an event on Friday, 4 March, in Los Angeles. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">It was billed as a "celebration of all things Welsh and Wrexham AFC" with the now very Welsh Rob McElhenney invited as the special guest. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The venue, The Pendry, secured by Efe Sokol, head of the Welsh government's Northeast region of North America, was suitably glamorous. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Guests walked the red carpet outside, to a beautifully decorated inside space complete with mannequins sporting the three Wrexham AFC kits, as Welsh musician Tom Lewis greeted them with traditional Welsh song. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The turnout was incredible. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Members of the creative industry in Hollywood, people from the world of sport, and Welsh expats from across America came together. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"The creative industry and sport are the two priorities for the Welsh government in North America, and it is so important that we can bring everyone together, make new connections, and make new relationships to help build the profile of Wales here and create more opportunities and jobs for Wales and Welsh people," said Eoghan O'Regan, deputy head of the Welsh government in the US. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The event was also an opportunity for Welsh language media to demonstrate that Wales can perform on a global stage, and that Wales is open for co-productions and partnerships. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">I managed to catch up with S4C's newly appointed chief executive Sian Doyle, who flew in to attend the event. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Sian boasts extensive experience in the telecommunications and retail sectors in the UK and North America, and will be focused on catapulting S4C into the global media market, empowering talent in Wales, and bringing Welsh language to the world stage. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"It's so wonderful to be here," said Sian. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"There is genuine goodwill and warmth towards Wales and the Welsh language. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"It is such a great opportunity to bring Wales to Los Angeles, and Los Angeles to Wales, and to create really valuable partnerships for Wales," said Sian. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">She addressed the audience along with Dr Zowie Hay, head of the Welsh government in North America, who spoke of how Wrexham AFC has played such an integral role in raising the profile of Wales and the Welsh language over the last year. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Wrexham AFC executive director Humphrey Ker also gave a small speech before introducing the man who most definitely stole the show, Rob McElhenney. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Prior to the event, many people had asked whether Rob would say something in Welsh, and Rob did not disappoint. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">He began by addressing everyone in Welsh - as he had done when he first walked out and spoke in front of fans on the Racecourse stadium back in November. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">After wishing everyone a good evening, and delivering a couple of lines, Rob switched to English and entertained the room with stories of Pennsylvania, Wrexham, and his realisation that story of Wrexham is now far bigger than he ever thought it would be. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">This video can not be played</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"At one point I'm just in the middle of California, looking at the ocean enjoying my life, and the next I am right in the middle of Welsh culture," says Rob. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"And suddenly I realised that this is a far bigger movement, it's not just about football." </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The room was very visibly moved by Rob's words, and the emotion was real and shared by all, Welsh or not, as he finished his speech by shouting "Cymru am byth!" before leading the crowd in Welsh song. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">For me, it was a huge moment of personal pride. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">My father's family is from Wrexham, so I feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to be part of the Wrexham story in a small way, and to have got to know Rob and Ryan a little, and watch Rob get better in Welsh. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">I remember growing up and experiencing those incidents that many of us have shared, on public transport or in a social setting, and hearing visitors to Wales say loudly that I was only speaking Welsh to my sister or friends so that they wouldn't understand. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">I was so lucky to have grown up with a mother who, despite being English, instilled in me a pride and passion for the Welsh language, and encouraged my siblings and I to speak Welsh. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">As I have moved through my career and became an international journalist living in the US, I made a firm decision to prioritise Welsh language broadcasting. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Some of the proudest moments of my career have been delivering the American story to S4C Newyddion, BBC Radio Cymru and online audiences. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">As the Welsh language media, I believe, we should be pushing boundaries and creating headlines in Welsh. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Rob and Ryan have brought the Welsh language to the world and began to break down barriers. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">When their documentary series <i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Welcome to Wrexham</i> comes out later this year, I doubt there will be a single person who hasn't heard of Wrexham and of Wales. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Rob's love of the country is real, and it is inspiring others to feel the same - and that was most certainly felt at the event on Friday night. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">I sat down and chatted with Rob during a quiet moment, and for the first time, I was able to put a question to him entirely in Welsh:</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"Rob, how is your Welsh language learning going?" I asked. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">And without missing a beat, Rob responded in perfect Welsh: "I love the Welsh language, and I'm working on improving."</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">And I thought to myself, it won't surprise me if next year, Rob really is standing up here in front of everyone and telling jokes in Welsh. </p>
