<p>"Elena Branson… actively subverted foreign agent registration laws in the United States in order to promote Russian policies and ideology," according to Damian Williams, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. "Branson is alleged to have corresponded with Putin himself and met with a high-ranking Russia minister before founding a Russian propaganda center here in New York City, the Russian Center New York."</p>
<p>FARA requires foreign agents to register and disclose their work if they engage in political or public relations work "on behalf of a foreign principal," according to the Justice Department.</p>
<p>The 36-page, six-count criminal complaint, filed in federal court Tuesday, alleges that Branson’s subterfuge began in 2011. She is also known as Elena Chernykh, according to court documents.</p>

<p>In 2013, she also allegedly set up a U.S.-based organization, funded by the Kremlin, that hosted annual pro-Russia events. A year later, prosecutors claim she set up a pro-Russian website and promoted Kremlin propaganda. She allegedly helped Russian nationals apply for visas to enter the U.S. under false pretenses. And in 2019, she allegedly lobbied Hawaii lawmakers not to rename a former Russian fort located on Kauai.</p>
