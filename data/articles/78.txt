<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Mohammed al-Qahtani, 46, was repatriated to Saudi Arabia after a review board determined that he no longer posed a "significant threat". </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The board noted his "significantly compromised mental health condition".</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Qahtani was tortured so badly by US interrogators after his detention in 2001 that he could not be put on trial.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The review board said last month that a condition for his transfer should be his participation in Saudi Arabia's rehabilitation centre for jihadists, known as the Prince Mohammed Bin Nayef Centre for Counselling and Care, where he could receive comprehensive mental health care.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">US authorities have alleged that Qahtani was meant to be on board United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed in Pennsylvania after being hijacked by four al-Qaeda militants on 9/11. However, he had been prevented from entering the US the previous month.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Qahtani was captured four months later on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and brought to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba in February 2002.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Investigators there received approval to use "more aggressive interrogation techniques" on Qahtani after he resisted conventional methods.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Between November 2002 and January 2003, he was subjected to prolonged isolation, sleep deprivation, sexual humiliation and exposure to cold. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">In 2009, a top official in then-President George W Bush's administration, Susan Crawford, told the Washington Post that Qahtani's treatment "met the legal definition of torture" and that she had decided to not refer him for prosecution as a consequence.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"This was not any one particular act; this was just a combination of things that had a medical impact on him, that hurt his health. It was abusive and uncalled for. And coercive," she said.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">A psychiatrist hired by Qahtani's lawyers told a US court that the torture had aggravated a childhood brain injury and schizophrenia that he developed as an adolescent, according to the New York Times. The newspaper also cited court documents as saying that Qahtani had refused psychotropic medication and repeatedly tried to kill himself in recent years.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The defence department said 38 detainees remained at Guantanamo following Qahtani's release.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Nineteen are eligible for transfer, while 10 others are awaiting trial by military commissions, including alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. </p>
