<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Guy Reffitt, 49, from Texas, was convicted of five charges including obstruction of an official proceeding and interfering with police in a riot.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The case was being closely watched as a possible bellwether for hundreds more cases related to that day which will come to trial in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Jurors took under four hours to unanimously convict Reffitt. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">According to investigators, Reffitt was among the mob of Donald Trump supporters that stormed the Capitol on 6 January as lawmakers met to confirm Joe Biden's presidential win. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Reffitt - an oil-field worker and alleged member of the Three Percenters far-right militia - drove from Texas to Washington DC to participate in the riot, and led fellow members of the Three Percenters up the Capitol's staircase to the building. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">In court, prosecutors used Reffitt's own words against him, telling jurors that he "lit the match" during the riot. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Reffitt faces up to 60 years in prison. His sentencing is scheduled for 8 June. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Reffitt's prosecution was aided by multiple videos taken on and after 6 January, in which he discussed planning and later bragged about his participation in the riot. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The videos included a 30-minute clip recorded with a helmet camera among the crowd outside the Capitol, and a self-recorded Zoom call in which he bragged about the day's events. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Among those who testified against him was his 19-year-old son Jackson, who said his father threatened him to keep quiet. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"He said 'if you turn me in, you're a traitor," the younger Reffitt testified about his father. "And traitors get shot". </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Another witness, Rocky Hardie, testified that he travelled to Washington in a car with Reffitt that contained weapons and ammunition. He added that Reffitt carried a pistol and zip ties during the riot. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">During the trial, Reffitt's defence attorney, William L Welch, called no witnesses and presented no evidence, but said that Reffitt had not assaulted police officers during the riot and characterised Reffitt as being prone to exaggerating. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00"><b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">A verdict heard around the world</b>It was the trial of one man, but it has far-reaching and significant implications: the guilty verdict, delivered quickly and on all counts, serves as a guide to how other 6 January trials may go. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">With their verdict, members of the jury in Reffitt's trial showed that they believe the Capitol siege was an assault on democracy. They also made it clear that they thought that Reffitt's claim, that he was just a big talker and meant no harm, was beside the point. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The guilty verdict means that others who have been accused of crimes related to the 6 January riot - and there are hundreds of these individuals - will be more likely to plea bargain, rather than risk facing a jury.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">To date, more than 750 people have been arrested for their role in the 6 January riot, including members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">While most have been charged with misdemeanours, about 40 have received prison sentences. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The leader of the far-right Proud Boys group has been charged with conspiracy in connection with the Capitol riot. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Enrique Tarrio, 38, was arrested on Tuesday morning in Miami, Florida, according to the Justice Department. </p>
