<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">That's how Hollywood composer Germaine Franco responded to the news that she had been nominated for an Oscar for best original score for Disney's latest hit animation, Encanto.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">While the ubiquitous Lin-Manuel Miranda is responsible for every parent's favourite earworm We Don't Talk About Bruno and the film's numerous other catchy songs, it's Franco who is behind the magical score, which seamlessly blends with Miranda's work.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">She is the first woman to score a Disney animated film, the first Latina to join the music branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and the first to receive an Oscar nomination for best original score.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">If she triumphs at Sunday's ceremony, she will be just the fifth female winner in 87 years.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Set in Colombia, Encanto is based around a family with fading magical powers who are battling to save their home. Franco has been thrilled with the film's reception and the soundtrack's chart-storming performance.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"The soundtrack is still sailing up there. The success is exciting, gratifying and so exhilarating. We've been going through this pandemic for so long... and to know that kids are enjoying it, and parents are enjoying watching their kids, that is really the best result we could hope for."</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Franco's extensive back catalogue includes work on Coco, The Lorax and How to Train Your Dragon 2. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">But it's Encanto and its Oscar buzz - the movie also has nominations for best original song (Miranda's Dos Oruguitas) and best animated feature - that has propelled her into the spotlight.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Miranda specifically asked for Franco to get on board, having heard her work on Coco.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"Every project is different. On this one, Lin had written most of the songs before I came on," she explains. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"My job is to make sure the score works with the existing songs and can weave in and out. And I was adding the orchestra to the songs. So the end of my score will always lead you to the very beginning of his song, harmonically. And that's why you don't really feel that there's a difference."</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Franco wanted to bring an authentic Colombian sound - but that was a challenge given that she couldn't travel there due to the pandemic.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"I did my best to bring Colombia to me and imagine what it was like, and also I did a lot of research, listening to many, many hours of Colombian music from all genres and periods," she says. "Classical, indigenous, Afro Colombian... I also decided I must use the Colombian instruments."</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">They included a Colombian harp, a flute called a gaita, a marimba and some hand drums called tamboras. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"I just thought, this has to be rich. Women's voices are a big part of Colombian music. And so I actually had a 12-piece choir on the track Antonio's Voice.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"Those instruments tell a story about culture from thousands of years ago."</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The score still has that familiar Disney feel, with its crashing crescendos, soaring strings and gentle playfulness.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"I've listened to Disney for so long, so I just I wanted to honour the sound of the classic Disney soundtrack while doing something different at the same time," Franco explains.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Her own musical journey began as a child in Texas. "I was just always that drummer girl, banging on stuff, as my mom would say.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"Nobody actually asked me to practice. I just would take the drums and sit at the piano. And I would just play for hours."</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Later, she studied music and "really started learning about orchestras".</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Franco began composing while at college, later writing for theatre before moving into film and TV.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">According to the latest annual Celluloid Ceiling report published by Women in TV and Film, just 7% of the top 250 highest-grossing films featured a score written by a woman. That's a small increase on the 5% figure in 2020, while the previous two years both came in at 6%. So it's slow progress.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Laura Karpman, who is currently writing The Marvels score, set up the the Alliance for Women Film Composers in 2014.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">She says: "I think most sexism is deeply insidious. It creeps up on you. I noticed early on that my male colleagues were having much greater success than I was in traditionally large scale and big budget projects.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"At first I thought it was something that I had done, but I started to realise it was not me but merely the fact that I was not seen as somebody who could handle the larger projects, no matter how many times I clearly proved that I could."</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">But she adds: "Things are opening up. I am so delighted and in fact shocked that the advocacy work that we have all done is working. You see what happens when women are given the opportunities. They get Oscar nominations."</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Rebecca Grierson, managing director at agency SixtyFour Talent, is the composer advocate for Free the Work, a talent initiative that aims to boost opportunities for under-represented groups.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">She says: "There is implicit and unconscious bias when hiring people of colour. Couple this with sexism and it's a steep hill to climb. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"Film-makers can help by considering more diverse composer reels and not always hiring the 'safe' option for a composer. Taking risks on new or up-and-coming composers is necessary to level the playing field."</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Fellow composer Dara Taylor also points out that award recognition is important.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"I believe that the common goal is for nominations such as these [Franco's] to become increasingly less historic and more commonplace," she says.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Franco says she is glad to be paving the way for others while also focusing on creating her best work.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"I feel happy to be in this place, to have other women and people of colour and just people who are different from the default composer to see they can can do it as well. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"I've gotten many, many letters and emails from women all over the world who are so happy this is happening. It's a positive moment. It inspires others to keep creating."</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">She notes that it's also important for people of colour to be offered more opportunities to work on all kinds of projects, not just ones related to their heritage.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"It depends on perception about your last name and what you look like - [the assumption] that you can only write certain types of music. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"I worked on Tag, which is a bro comedy, and Little, which is a black story of female power. I feel like now people are starting to remove the filter, but it is a concern that some composers of colour have felt that they don't get called for a certain type of film."</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Franco says she tries to "just get to work" and "not think about the barriers".</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">But she acknowledges that "the barriers exist... they're changing but they're still there".</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"I've had people come into my studio and say: 'Oh, did you study music?' The person that I was supposed to collaborate with asking me if I have a music degree! </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"I've even had a journalist ask me if I've ever studied music and it's just, you know, jaw drop! There are those instances when you walk in and you're the only woman and people think you don't know the difference between, say, the type of recording resolutions."</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">She's philosophical about the state of play.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"Some people have their preconceived ideas... but I try not to focus on that too much because I want to focus on the positive. As artists, we just have to keep going. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"The answer is to keep putting out that body of work and then pretty soon people will see it."</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">And on her Oscar potential?</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"I feel everything about this film has been a really great experience, anything else that happens... I'm considering it with gratitude."</p>
