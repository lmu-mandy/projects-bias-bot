<div><h1 class="ssrcss-15xko80-StyledHeading e1fj1fc10" id="main-heading" tabindex="-1">Covid map: Coronavirus cases, deaths, vaccinations by country</h1><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00"><b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 470 million confirmed cases and more than six million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. </b></p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by France, the UK and Russia. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Very few places have been left untouched. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">In the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Deaths are rising in some areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Data on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Using this metric, researchers suggest that more than 18 million people may have died because of Covid up to the end of 2021. That figure is three times higher than officially recorded deaths from the disease. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Nearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 119 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">According to that data, more than 65% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is about 15%. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Of those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Singapore and Italy have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The new Omicron variant of coronavirus appeared to trigger a spike in cases globally, although the number of official daily cases has fallen sharply in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Studies suggest that Omicron - which quickly became dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said there was now a "very worrying increase in deaths, in most regions of the world" and it was "premature for any country either to surrender, or to declare victory".</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00"><b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Asia</b></p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Asia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, shows a mixed picture with case numbers rising rapidly in some countries while falling sharply in others.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">South Korea, Vietnam, Japan and Thailand are all experiencing their highest wave of infections since the start of the pandemic.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">In contrast, India has seen its daily cases fall sharply, registering 2,000 cases per day on average. The country has now recorded more than 43 million cases in total - second only to the US. The official death toll in India is more than 516,000. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">China has maintained a zero-Covid policy since the first outbreak in 2019, with harsh restrictions and widespread testing. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">However it is facing a new spike in cases in the north-east of the country driven by the Omicron variant, with thousands of cases reported each day and millions of people placed under lockdown. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Hong Kong, which was previously almost untouched by the virus, is now seeing 30,000 cases and more than 200 deaths a day.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Overall, China has reported more than a million cases and more than 10,500 coronavirus deaths - still much lower than the figures reported by other major nations despite the recent surge.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00"><b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Europe</b></p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Daily cases are now lower in many European countries than their previous peaks, though some are seeing a rise driven by an easily spread sub-variant of Omicron, called BA.2.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria have recently seen their daily infections increase.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">France has also seen the number of cases rise in recent days, but some way off the seven-day average of over 350,000 cases a day recorded at the end of January. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">In the UK, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show a continued rise in infections last week, while official data also shows a gradual increase in Covid hospital admissions. However, hospitalisations and deaths appear to have been greatly reduced due to the UK's widespread vaccination rollout. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00"><b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">North America</b></p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The US has recorded around 79 million cases and over 970,000 deaths - the highest figures in the world. Daily cases and death counts have started to fall, but deaths remain around 1,000 a day on average. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Dr Anthony Fauci, the country's chief adviser on infectious disease, has said the latest wave now seems to be going in the right direction but hospitalisations could still put pressure on health services in areas of the country where people had not been fully vaccinated or had a booster.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Canada recently recorded its highest number of daily deaths since the country's first wave of coronavirus cases in May 2020, peaking around 165 per day at the end of January. However, the death rate in Canada remains far lower than that of the US.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00"><b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Latin America</b></p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">In Latin America, cases are falling nearly everywhere after a recent rise in many countries.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Brazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, recording more than 29 million cases and 657,000 deaths - the world's second-highest official death toll. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">In Peru, there have been almost 212,000 deaths and the country has the world's highest number of deaths by population size - more than 640 deaths for every 100,000 people.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00"><b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Africa</b></p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Africa has seen more than 11 million cases and 250,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">According to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 3.7 million confirmed cases and nearly 100,000 deaths. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">South Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - the fourth wave of infections in the country.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00"><b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Middle East</b></p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Several countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 139,000 and it has seen over seven million confirmed cases. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Neighbouring Iraq has seen 25,000 deaths and in excess of two million confirmed cases.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The recent wave in Israel is falling. Its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. It has now begun administering a fourth vaccine dose to people aged over 60 and to healthcare workers.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00"><b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Oceania</b></p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Early in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but both have now seen their first spike in cases. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Daily case figures are rising in Australia. So far, the country has seen more than 3.9 million confirmed cases and over 5,700 deaths. Last month, Australia reopened its borders to vaccinated tourists and other visa holders for the first time in almost two years.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Daily cases are also rising in New Zealand, which has recorded almost 500,000 cases but only 163 deaths. Plans for a limited reopening of the border are still going ahead.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Covid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">It was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands. Figures for France are for the mainland only and include both suspected and confirmed cases.</p>
