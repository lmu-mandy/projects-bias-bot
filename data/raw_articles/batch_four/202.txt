<div class="zn-body__paragraph">"I was so moved to see Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson confirmed this afternoon," the former first lady wrote in an Instagram post. "Like so many of you, I can't help but feel a sense of pride -- a sense of joy -- to know that this deserving, accomplished Black woman will help chart our nation's course.
