<p class="speakable">The three kits of the rabies-infected fox that bothered lawmakers and reporters on Capitol Hill this week have been euthanized, city officials announced Thursday.</p>
<p class="speakable">The three baby foxes, called kits, were discovered on Capitol grounds shortly after the mother was captured, euthanized and tested for rabies. The mother tested positive, but city officials have not announced test results for the kits.</p>
<p>"Since the mother tested positive for the rabies virus and the kits could have been exposed during grooming or other means, they were no longer able to be safely rehabilitated," D.C. Health said.</p>
