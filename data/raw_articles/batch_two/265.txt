<p class="speakable">A Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office helicopter crashed on Saturday evening, leaving six occupants injured but expected to survive, according to reports.</p>
<p class="speakable">Aboard the helicopter were five sheriff's deputies and one doctor from UCLA, Sheriff Alex Villanueva told reporters at a news conference, FOX 11 of Los Angeles reported.</p>
<p>All six occupants were transported to a trauma center, FOX 11 reported. All were in stable condition with injuries ranging from fractures to broken ribs, authorities said, according to the Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p>"Thankfully nothing that is life-threatening at this time," Villanueva told reporters, according to the Los Angeles Daily News. He called that fact that all six occupants survived, "nothing short of a miracle."</p>
<p>The helicopter crashed near San Gabriel Dam and Highway 39 as the deputies and doctor were traveling to the scene of a roadway crash, the station reported. The aircraft was attempting to land at the time, the report said.</p>

<p>There were low-hanging clouds in the area but otherwise no unusual weather or mechanical conditions, the Times reported.</p>
<p>The spot where the helicopter hit the ground was close to an area where there was a 200-foot drop, so the incident could have been far worse, Villanueva told reporters, according to FOX 11.</p>
<p>An aerial photo showed the helicopter flipped over on the ground but mostly intact.</p>
