<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00"><b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">A ban on race-based hair discrimination in the United States is a step closer after a vote in Congress.</b></p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The House of Representatives passed the legislation which seeks to end discrimination against natural hair at work and school.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The Crown (Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair) Act must still be approved by the Senate. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">President Joe Biden has urged lawmakers to swiftly pass the law.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Black Americans say they are often treated unfairly at work and in schools because of their natural hair textures or protective styles like braids, knots, twists and locs. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">If the Crown Act becomes law, natural hair discrimination would be treated as if it were race or national origin discrimination under federal civil rights law. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Until then, advocates say that employers and institutions can discriminate against black Americans based on how they style their natural hair.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Adjoa B Asamoah, legislative strategist for the CROWN Coalition, praised Friday's vote in the House, but acknowledged a potential uphill battle in the Senate.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"There's the shift in policy and then there's a shift in culture," Ms Asamoah said.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"This is about confronting this Eurocentric standard of beauty, tackling anti-blackness, and lifting the natural African aesthetic. The diversity of Blackness is beautiful."</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The CROWN Coalition partners with more than 85 organisations to pass statewide bans on hair discrimination, and advocate for the bill nationally.  </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Just on Thursday, the Massachusetts House of Representatives unanimously voted to advance its bill to its state senate.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">A third of black children in majority-white schools have faced race-based hair discrimination, according to a 2021 study by DOVE and the CROWN Coalition. The survey found 86% of children say they have experienced it by the age of 12.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">More than a dozen states have already passed similar laws aimed at ending hair discrimination.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Just on Thursday, the Massachusetts House of Representatives unanimously voted to advance its bill to its state senate.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">When Chicago mother Ida Nelson was told her four-year-old son Jett's braids were prohibited by his pre-school, she says she thought administrators were joking. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">But when the school told her the hairstyle must be removed in order for him to go class, she decided to fight back. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">After months of campaigning, Ms Nelson was able to get the Jett Hawkins Act, which prohibits hair discrimination in schools, passed in Illinois. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">She said Friday's move to advance the national Crown Act made her feel "vindicated". </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"When we step into our power, epic things get done," she added. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"This was a collective effort from everyone from four-year-olds to senior citizens coming together to say, 'No, our hair and our ability to show up as our authentic selves is not negotiable'."  </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">A statement from President Biden said he believed "no person should be denied the ability to obtain a job, succeed in school or the workplace, secure housing, or otherwise exercise their rights based on a hair texture or hair style".</p>
