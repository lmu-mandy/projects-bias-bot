<p class="speakable">Wildfires ripping through West Texas this week prompted evacuations on Thursday and Friday, according to local authorities. </p>
<p class="speakable">The Texas A&amp;M Forest Service issued a wildfire danger warning Thursday in the Gainesville, Fort Worth, Wichita Falls, Abilene, Midland, San Angelo, Austin, San Antonio and Del Rio areas, noting that high wind speeds of up to 40 mph with low humidity are fueling fires.</p>
<p>"Texas A&amp;M Forest Service has been monitoring the fire environment and increased wildfire activity this week," Wes Moorehead, Texas A&amp;M Forest Service Fire Chief, said in a Wednesday statement. "The potential for significant, large wildfires has developed. … Wildfires that ignite under these forecast conditions are highly resistant to firefighters’ suppression efforts and pose a threat to public safety. We encourage residents to be cautious tomorrow, be prepared and listen to warnings from local officials."</p>
