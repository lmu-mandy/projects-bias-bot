<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Will Wysoglad, a high school senior in Illinois, went viral after posting video diaries documenting how he was repeatedly sent home because he went to school mask-less.  An Illinois judge had recently ruled schools couldn't require masks. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">But while two-thirds of American schools have dropped mask requirements, there are students fighting to keep those requirements in place over public health concerns. That includes Leif Aucoin, a theatre major sophomore in Nevada.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">We asked both students why they were protesting, and how mask requirement changes in schools were affecting them.</p>
