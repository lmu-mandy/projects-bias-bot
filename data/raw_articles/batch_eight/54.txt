<p>Texas law prevents most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, following a law enacted on September 1, 2021. The law was subject to immediate criticism from pro-choice groups but no legal challenges to overturn or suspend the law have been successful. These challenges include rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court in December 2021 and the Texas Supreme Court in March 2022.</p>

<p>The law provides private citizens the ability to sue individuals who "aid or abet" a prohibited abortion but does not penalize the person receiving the abortion. It is not immediately clear if this law could be applied in Herrera’s case. </p>
