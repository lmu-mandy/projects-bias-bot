<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The eldest Biden grandchild, 28, and her fiancé, Peter Neal, 24, will celebrate at perhaps the most exclusive venue in the US. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Ms Biden said she was "endlessly grateful" to her "Nana and Pop" for the honour. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Four other wedding receptions have ever been held at the presidential home. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Ms Biden, a graduate of Columbia Law School and the daughter of Hunter Biden and Kathleen Buhle, announced her engagement to Mr Neal, a law student at the University of Pennsylvania, in September.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Ms Biden will only be the fifth bride to have a White House wedding reception, to be held in November. The previous one took place in 2008, when Jenna Bush Hager, daughter of former president George W Bush, celebrated a month after she was wed in Texas. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">It has actually been more common to hold wedding ceremonies themselves at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue - there have been 18 in total.</p>

<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The wedding of Nellie Grant, daughter of President Ulysses S Grant, in May 1874, was seen as the most elaborate event ever held at the White House at the time.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Two hundred and fifty guests gathered in the East Room, decorated with masses of white flowers and Nellie's white satin dress fell into a six-foot train. Still, like many weddings, it was also a stressful affair. Mr and Mrs Grant were said to be concerned about their 19-year-old daughter's wedding to Algernon Sartoris, a diplomat.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">One sitting president has said "I do" at the White House: President Grover Cleveland wed Frances Folson in the Blue Room in June 1886.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Other recent White House weddings have included those of Lynda Bird Johnson - daughter of President Lyndon Johnson - who married Charles Spittal Robb in a grand event in the East Room in 1967. In 1971, Tricia Nixon - daughter of President Richard Nixon and Pat Nixon, was the first to hold a wedding in the White House Rose Garden. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The latest White House wedding, in 2013, was one of just three not involving family of the president. Pete Souza, who was chief White House photographer under President Barack Obama, married fiancée Pattie Lease in the Rose Garden.</p>
