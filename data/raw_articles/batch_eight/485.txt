<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Omer Kuzu, 26, testified on Monday that he met El Shafee Elsheikh in Syria on at least five occasions.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">He said while they did not talk much, Mr Elsheikh had an air of importance. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Mr Elsheikh, 33, is accused of kidnapping and conspiracy and has denied all the charges. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The Sudanese-born Londoner is alleged to have been part of an IS militant cell dubbed the Beatles by hostages because of their British accents. He is the highest profile IS fighter to face trial in the US.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The cell is said to have tortured and beheaded hostages in Syria, including several Western journalists and aid workers.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Mr Kuzu, who spent four-and-a-half years as an IS member, testified at Mr Elsheikh's trial in Virginia as part of a plea deal with the US government.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">He said he had left his home in Dallas, Texas at age 18 in October 2014 and was smuggled into Syria alone through the Turkish border.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">He told the court he worked at the telecommunications office in the city of Raqqa, then "the capital of IS", and did "typical IT work" to support the group's battlefield operations.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Mr Kuzu was captured by Syrian forces in 2019 and handed over to the FBI. He pleaded guilty in Texas in September 2020 to conspiracy to provide material support to IS. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Taking the stand on Monday, he leaned forward into his microphone and spoke clearly, often saying "yes sir" in response to questions.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Mr Kuzu said that while other guards wore traditional Afghan clothes, Mr Elsheikh wore a green military uniform and always carried a Glock pistol.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Having a Glock was uncommon among the fighters, he said, calling it "a symbol of Isis aristocracy".</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">He added that Mr Elsheikh was "quiet, reserved, almost secretive", which he believed indicated he didn't want to be a target of foreign intelligence agencies.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Mr Kuzu appeared in court in a teal prison jumpsuit. He spoke clearly, often leaning forward into the microphone and saying "yes sir" in response to questions. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Asked to identify Mr Elsheikh in the courtroom, he pointed at the defendant and described his clothing.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Mr. Elsheikh, who has sat through much of the trial in a disposable black mask, lowered his mask to be identified.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Identification is a key part of the trial. The defence argues that Mr Elsheikh was a "simple Isis fighter" not one of the so-called Beatles, and therefore should not be held responsible for what that militant cell did.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Under cross-examination, Mr Kuzu admitted that  Mr Elsheikh had never explicitly told him about himself or what he did for IS.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">But he said "his work was right in front of my eyes".</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The Beatles have been described by witnesses as a cohesive unit.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">When Mr Kuzu met Mr Elsheikh and another alleged Beatle on one occasion, they appeared to be "some sort of a duo or tag team" to him.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Former French IS hostage Didier Francois echoed similar sentiments when he took the stand on Monday.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">He told the court "the atmosphere changed radically" whenever the Beatles showed up.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"They were always together and always sadistic," the veteran war correspondent said, explaining they engaged in both physical and emotional abuse.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"Manicure or pedicure?" they would ask, he claimed, before beating his hands and feet.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Mr Francois was held alongside three other French journalists for 10 months before the men were all released together in April 2014.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">During his captivity, he describes interacting with several other hostages, including Americans James Foley and Peter Kassig.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Both men converted to Islam while in captivity. Choking up, Mr Francois recalled the former asking him to tell his Catholic mother he had only done so because "he loved his God and wanted to be able to worship him".</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The government is expected to wrap its case against Mr Elsheikh on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">It remains unclear whether Mr Elsheik intends to take the stand when the defence gets its turn.</p>
