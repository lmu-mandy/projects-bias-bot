<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The announcement sent Twitter shares soaring by more than 27% in New York trading on Monday.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Tesla's chief executive owned 73,486,938 shares in the social media platform as of 14 March, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The stake is worth $2.89bn (£2.2bn), based on Twitter's closing price on Friday.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">It makes him the largest shareholder in the company, with more than four times the 2.25% holding of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Mr Musk is a regular Twitter user with more than 80 million followers, although recently he said he is giving "serious thought" to building a new social media platform. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Late last month, Mr Musk asked his followers whether they thought the social media platform encouraged free speech.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?"</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">He then asked: "Is a new platform needed?"</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">He regularly uses Twitter to share updates from the companies he owns - including SpaceX and Neuralink. He is also known for sharing memes, adding to his popularity among fans.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">But some posts have drawn controversy.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Last year he tweeted in response to a claim, made by the head of the UN World Food Programme (WFP), that just 2% of Mr Musk's wealth could help to solve world hunger.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">In October, Mr Musk said he would sell $6bn in Tesla stock and donate it to the WFP, provided it could describe "exactly how $6bn will solve world hunger".</p>

<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Mr Musk saw the valuation of his Tesla car company surpass a market value of $1 trillion last autumn, making it the fifth such firm to reach the milestone, after Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google-owner Alphabet.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Soon after he took to Twitter to ask users if he should sell a 10% stake in the electric carmaker.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">More than 3.5 million Twitter users voted, with nearly 58% voting in favour of the share sale leading to Musk selling around $5bn (£3.7bn) of shares in the firm in November.</p>
