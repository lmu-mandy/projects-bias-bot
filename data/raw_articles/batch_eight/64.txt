<p>Police added that Lee became trapped after attempting to retrieve someone's personal property. They also said the incident was not due to a ride malfunction.</p>
<p>"The man went down to get another person's hat and I guess the floors, or whatever, had went down on him and pinned him in," witness Keirra Peterson told First Coast News.</p>
<p>"I didn’t really expect that, I never thought that since that boy the other week that fell off that ride. I didn’t think I would experience another ride misfunction," Peterson added.</p>
