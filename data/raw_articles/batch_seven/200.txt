<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Just before 11 p.m., police responded to a report of a shooting and discovered a 16-year-old female suffering from a non-life-threatening gunshot wound, police spokesperson Kristen Metzger said.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">An adult male was then found on another street nearby, south of the stadium, with a wound of similar severity.  </div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Another adult male and a 17-year-old male were found with gunshot wounds at the Navy Yard Metro Station, which is just north of the stadium, according to Metzger.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">None of the victims' injuries appear to be life-threatening, Metzger told CNN in an email Sunday.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">In a tweet late Saturday night, police said they were looking for two people potentially connected to the shooting, but as of Sunday morning, there were no suspects in custody.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">The Metropolitan Police Department said it was looking for a man in a black sweatshirt and light jeans carrying a silver handgun and a woman wearing a blue hoodie or jacket with white writing, CNN affiliate WJLA reported.</div>
