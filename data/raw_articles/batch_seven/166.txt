<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The accused claims to be Arthur Knight, a victim of mistaken identity who says he has never been to the United States.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">But US prosecutors believe he is Nicholas Rossi and want him returned to Utah to face a rape charge. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">They say he fled to Scotland after faking his own death. He was arrested at a hospital in Glasgow in December.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">He has been on bail since.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The man told a preliminary hearing at Edinburgh Sheriff Court his name was Arthur Knight. The court heard the man's identity remains in dispute.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Defence lawyer Anna Kocela said she had not formally instructed solicitors about his case.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">But the accused, who arrived in a wheelchair and was wearing an oxygen mask in court, claimed he had.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">When Ms Kocela confirmed a second time that her firm had not been given information about the case, Sheriff Nigel Ross urged the accused to contact a lawyer before proceedings can continue.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">He gave him a deadline of two weeks.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The man attempted several times during the hearing to ask for an extension, but this was denied.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Sheriff Ross had to ask him to stop interrupting during the hearing.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">He told him: "Make sure with haste you have a discussion with whichever lawyer you wish to instruct and have them come and address the court in two weeks' time."</p>
