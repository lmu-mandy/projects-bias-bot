<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Karen Wells, Amir Locke's mother, said she was angered by the prosecutors' decision not to pursue criminal charges against a Minneapolis officer who fatally shoot 22-year-old Amir Locke in a no-knock raid in February. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"I am angry. I am mad. I am disgusted with Minneapolis, Minnesota," Ms Wells said. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Amir Locke was shot while he was sleeping on a couch as the police entered the property with a no-knock warrant.  Locke was not the target of the warrant and was holding a gun for which he had a permit.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">His death sparked protests in downtown Minneapolis and drew comparisons to the death of Breonna Taylor, who was shot dead by the police in Kentucky during a no-knock raid.</p>
