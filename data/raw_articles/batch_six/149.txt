<p class="speakable">Two Alabama men are accused of inciting or encouraging a riot after authorities said messages were spread online encouraging the spring break "takeover" of a Florida beach town.</p>
<p class="speakable">More than 160 people were arrested, about 75 illegal guns were confiscated and several businesses closed during a wild weekend late last month in Panama City Beach, police said.</p>
<p>Social media influencers and others promoted "Panamaniac" on Facebook and other social media platforms, authorities said.</p>

<p>Demarion Tyâ€™Quan Cooper, 20 and Rashad Boyce Glasper, 25, were arrested Thursday at their homes in the Alabama cities of Troy and Wetumpka, police said.</p>
<p>"Law enforcement determined Cooper and Glasper played a substantial role in promoting and influencing their followers to create this disorder with a propensity for violence," Panama City Beach Police said in a statement announcing the arrests. More arrests are expected, police added.</p>

<p>It was not known Friday whether the Alabama men have lawyers who would speak on their behalf.</p>
<p>Now, "takeover" events planned for later this month in the Destin area are circulating on social media, WJHG-TV reported. At a recent news conference, sheriff's officials in Walton and Okaloosa counties said they won't tolerate lawlessness during upcoming weekends in that part of Florida's Panhandle.</p>
