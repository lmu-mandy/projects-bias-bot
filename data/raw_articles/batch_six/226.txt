<div><h1 class="pg-headline">Tiger Woods struggles in second round at the Masters after excellent open following long injury layoff</h1><p class="zn-body__paragraph speakable"><cite class="el-editorial-source"> (CNN)</cite>Tiger Woods struggled at the beginning of his second round at the Masters Friday, following an excellent return to competitive golf.</p>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">The five-time Masters champion capped off a remarkable comeback to golf Thursday as he carded a one-under 71 in the opening round at Augusta National. </div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">The 46-year-old Woods displayed all his poise and experience to finish near the top of the leaderboard, just four shots behind leader Im Sung-jae at the end of the day.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">As he looks to complete what would be another fairy-tale story and make the cut in his first appearance in a professional golf tournament since his February 2021 car crash, Woods hoped<strong> </strong>for more of the same on day two of the 2022 Masters.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">With a large crowd watching on and anticipation in the air, the 15-time major winner stepped up and blasted his ball down the first hole, only for it to find the bunker on the right of the fairway.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">He would end up bogeying the opening hole, moving him back to even par for the tournament.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">And his slow start to the second round continued over the next two holes, rescuing a par on the par-five second hole before missing a short putt on the third hole for his second bogey in three holes, putting him at one over par.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Unfortunately for Woods, another bogey was to follow on the par-three fourth hole, when his par putt fell just inches short. According to the PGA Tour, the three-over through four holes start is Woods' worst score through four holes in 92 career rounds at the Masters Tournament.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">It got worse for Woods still, as another bogey on the fifth hole dropped him to three over for the tournament.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">However, from there, Woods slowly recovered. He earned hard-fought pars on holes 6 and 7 before a vital birdie on the eighth hole helped drag him back to two over.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">And the recovery only got better from there, with the shot of his second round so far coming on the 10th hole, leaving him with a very short putt for a second birdie in three holes, which dragged him to one over.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>An unbelievable story</h3></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Nobody expected Woods to be playing at the Masters this year. </div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Following a car crash in February 2021 in which he sustained serious leg injuries, he has only appeared in public on a golf course just once, at the PNC Championship in December with his son Charlie. Then Woods used a golf cart to help him get around the course.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Speculation first began to mount regarding Woods' participation in the tournament when his private jet was sighted landing at an airport near Augusta last week.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">And a few practice rounds before the Thursday's opening round only heightened the rumor. Woods said on Monday it would "be a game-time decision" on whether he plays at the Masters.</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">He confirmed his participation later in the week, and has been the main draw at the tournament -- drawing huge swathes of patrons and media attention -- as he makes his way around the Augusta National course.</div>
