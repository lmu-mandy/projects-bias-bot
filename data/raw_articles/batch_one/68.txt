<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Governor Ron DeSantis is expected to sign the measure, which would bar teachers from teaching these topics to children under 10 years old.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Critics say the bill will isolate LGBT youth. Proponents say it is about empowering parents on education issues.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Activists have dubbed it the Don't Say Gay bill. It is officially known as the Parental Rights in Education Bill.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The Republican-backed legislation passed on Tuesday. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">It prohibits any instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity between kindergarten and third grade - when students are roughly between five and nine years old. It also calls on school districts to avoid LGBT topics "when not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students".  </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday decried the passing of "hateful legislation targeting vulnerable students".</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">President Joe Biden and his administration are "with LGBTQI+ students everywhere", she wrote on Twitter. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">State laws that ban or constrain the discussion of LGBT life in classrooms - sometimes called "no promo homo" laws by critics - are not uncommon. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Four US states - Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas - currently have laws on the books that explicitly prohibit or limit sex education to heterosexual activity. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The Florida bill also extends to student support services, including counselling, and grants parents the power to sue schools directly if they believe an educator has broken the law. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Representative Joe Harding, who sponsored the bill in Florida's statehouse, has said that the bill is simply about "empowering parents".  </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Critics say that vague language in the law could result in teachers and students being prevented from discussing their lives even outside the classroom. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"This is really about making it impossible for LGBT young people to speak for themselves," said Nadine Smith, the executive director of advocacy group Equality Florida.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Todd and Jeff Delmay - one of the first same-sex couples to get married in Florida - say this bill would make it impossible for their 11-year-old son Blake to talk freely about his dads. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"We have fought and won these battles to adopt children and to be a family and to be together," Todd told the BBC. "And they are now trying to find every way in which they can erase us and our families."</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">And the couple warned the bill could marginalise LGBT youth as they  come to terms with their identity. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"A child's need for acceptance in a safe space should always take precedence over some parents' belief," Todd said, adding that legal challenges were already under way. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The Florida Family Policy Council, a conservative group that supports the bill, said in a statement last week that it was "necessary because government schools in the US have become ideological, political and are more interested in shaping a child's politics and sexual inclinations than they are in teaching academics of reading, writing, math, and education". </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Governor DeSantis - widely regarded as a possible 2024 White House contender - endorsed the bill last month, saying it was part of a wider effort to make the education system "transparent" to parents.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The Florida bill is part of a fierce debate taking place across the US over children's education, how schools operate and what they teach.</p>
