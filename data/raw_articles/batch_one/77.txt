<div><h1 class="ssrcss-gcq6xq-StyledHeading e1fj1fc10" id="main-heading" tabindex="-1">Ukraine war: How reliant is the world on Russia for oil and gas?</h1><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00"><b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">The US, UK and EU have announced that they will restrict Russian oil imports.</b></p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The move came after Russia warned it could cut off gas supplies to European countries if an oil ban were to go ahead.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The US has announced a complete ban on Russian oil, gas and coal imports, after Ukraine called for sanctions to be expanded.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year, and the EU is reducing its imports by two-thirds.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The UK government says this allows enough time for them to find alternative supplies.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Deputy Russian Prime Minister Alexander Novak has said rejecting Russian oil would lead to "catastrophic consequences for the global market".</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Oil and gas prices have already risen sharply and could rise yet further if Russia halts exports.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Russia is the third biggest producer of oil in the world, behind the US and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Of about five million barrels of crude oil it exports each day, more than half of that goes to Europe.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The US is less reliant, with about 3% of its imported oil coming from Russia in 2020.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Ben McWilliams says it should be easier to find alternative oil suppliers than it is for gas, "as it's not so many pipelines. There are some coming from Russia but there's also a lot of shipments from elsewhere".</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The US has been asking Saudi Arabia to increase its oil production, but it has rebuffed previous US requests to boost output in order to reduce oil prices.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Saudi Arabia is the biggest producer in Opec, the oil cartel which accounts for about 60% of the crude oil traded internationally. Because of this Opec has a key role in influencing oil prices. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Russia is not in Opec but has been working with it since 2017 to place limits on oil production, in order to maintain earnings for producers.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The US is also looking at relaxing Venezuela's oil sanctions. It used to be a key US oil supplier, but recently Venezuela has largely been selling its oil to China. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Heating prices - which are already high - would increase even more.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Russian gas accounts for about 40% of the EU's natural gas imports. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">If this dried up, Italy and Germany would be especially vulnerable. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Europe could turn to existing gas exporters such Qatar - or Algeria and Nigeria, but there are practical obstacles to quickly expanding production.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Russia only provides about 5% of the UK's gas supplies, and the US doesn't import any Russian gas.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">However, prices in the UK and US are still up significantly due to the knock-on effect of supply shortages.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Not very easily.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"It's harder to substitute gas because we have these big pipes that are taking Russian gas to Europe," says Ben McWilliams, an energy policy research analyst.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The think tank Bruegel predicts that if Russia were to stop gas supplies to Europe, then Europe could possibly import more liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the US.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">It could also ramp up the use of other energy sources, but doing so is not quick or easy.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"Renewables take time to roll out so in the short term this is not a solution," says research analyst Simone Tagliapietra.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"So for next winter - what can make a difference is fuel switching such as opening up coal-fired power plants, as Italy and Germany have plans to do in case of an emergency."</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The EU has proposed a plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels before 2030 - including measures to diversify gas supplies and replace gas in heating and power generation.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Consumers will face rising energy and fuel bills as a result of this war. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">In the UK, household energy bills have been kept in check by an energy price cap.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">But bills will rise by £700 to about £2,000 in April when the cap is increased. They are expected to reach about £3,000 when the cap is increased again this autumn.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">UK petrol and diesel prices have also soared and petrol is expected to reach 175p a litre as the war continues. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">In the US, petrol costs have reached their highest levels since 2008, with the American Automobile Association saying that pump prices had jumped by 11% over the past week.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"I think if we're in a world where Russian oil and gas stop flowing to Europe then we're going to need rationing-style measures," says McWilliams.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"Part of the conversation now is, can we tell households to turn their thermostats down one degree, which can save a significant chunk of gas."</p>
