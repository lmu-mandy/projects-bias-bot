<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Prosecutors say the men, some of whom are alleged militia members, targeted Gretchen Whitmer over Covid rules she imposed early in the pandemic.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Lawyers for the accused say that the government's evidence is flimsy and have indicated an entrapment defence.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The closely-watched trial is expected to last about six weeks. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">According to the FBI, which says it interrupted the plot 17 months ago, the men had planned to blow up a bridge near the governor's vacation home, then kidnap her and put her on a "treason trial". Ultimately 14 alleged plotters were arrested in late 2020.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Six of the group were charged in a federal court. The other eight face separate state charges.  </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Two of the men who faced federal charges have already pleaded guilty and are expected to testify against the remaining four at the trial. The undercover FBI agents that infiltrated the group are also expected to testify, and have been forced by a judge to reveal their real names over the objections of prosecutors. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"Making it crystal clear to the jury and the public that inside the courtroom, nothing is undercover and everything is out in the open will best ensure fairness during trial and eventual acceptance and respect for whatever the jury ultimately decides," Chief US District Judge Robert Jonker ruled on Thursday.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Suspects Adam Fox, 38, Daniel Harris, 24, and Brandon Caserta, 33, are from Michigan, while Barry Croft, 46, is from the state of Delaware. </p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">All four are facing charges of kidnapping conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Mr Croft and Mr Harris are also facing charges of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Prosecutors say they will prove the men took specific steps towards achieving their plan, including travelling to the governor's home, testing explosives and training for combat against Gov Whitmer's security team.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">On Tuesday, around 100 potential jurors were indirectly asked about their personal politics, including whether they approve of Gov Whitmer and whether they view the 6 January Capitol riots as an "insurrection" or a "legitimate political protest".</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Rules ban lawyers from directly asking about political affiliation. The juror pool has been pulled from counties in northern Michigan, an area that skews Republican.</p>
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The time of the FBI's swoop came as Ms Whitmer's lockdown orders drew thousands of protesters to the state capitol, where many legally entered government buildings with semi-automatic rifles and other firearms. </p>
