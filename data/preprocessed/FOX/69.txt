<p class="speakable">Jillian Pisciotta captured the moment a drawbridge operator began raising the bridge span from the edge of the Intracoastal Waterway in Jupiter last month.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Twenty minutes went by, and the drawbridge began to open for a sailboat," Pisciotta told FOX 13 Tampa. "(The bridge) began to crush the boat and me and my friends were in shock, not knowing how to react."</p>

<p>Officials say the group of boaters tried to get away from the rain, but the boat was under a part of the bridge with posted signs reading, "Unauthorized personnel prohibited," "Danger: Moving Machinery," and "No Trespassing; Violators Will Be Prosecuted."</p>
<p>When the drawbridge began to rise, the machinery began pushing on part of the boat, crushing the side, according to FOX 13.</p>

<p>No injuries were reported. </p>
<p>The bridge tender was unaware a boat was underneath the bridge at the time, a Palm Beach County spokesperson told WSVN.</p>
