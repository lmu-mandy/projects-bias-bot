<p class="speakable"> A violent career criminal allegedly slashed a stranger in the face on the subway Sunday after he was released without bail for a similar attack on a woman in Brooklyn, Fox News Digital has learned.</p>
<p class="speakable">Brendan Dowling, 40, allegedly walked up to a 41-year-old man sitting on the J train and sliced open his face at about 8:30 a.m. March 6, as the subway car neared the Lower East Side station.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was Dowling's sixth arrest since he was released without bail in October after pleading guilty to attempted assault for slashing a woman in the head in Dec. 2020 in downtown Brooklyn, according to police and prosecutors.</p>
<p> It wasn't immediately clear why he was sprung from jail on the Brooklyn case, but he faces a mandatory minimum of 3 ½ years in prison when he's sentenced, court records show. </p>
<p>At Dowling's arraignment Monday in Manhattan criminal court, he was ordered held on $50,000 cash over $150,000 bond on charges of first-degree attempted assault and second-degree assault.</p>
<p>Manhattan prosecutors said they were probing whether the slashing was motivated by anti-Asian bias. It was the latest in a string of vicious assaults on straphangers. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Transit crimes surged 184% from Feb. 28 to March 6 compared to the same period in 2021, according to newly released data from New York Police Department. In the prior week, subway crime had surged 205% compared to the same period in 2021. </p>
<p>Fox News Digital was the first to report that anti-Asian hate crime complaints had skyrocketed by a staggering 343% from 2020 to 2021.</p>

<p>Another man, Denzel Hodge, was nabbed March 4 in Brooklyn and held without bail for allegedly stabbing two subway riders in separate incidents and assaulting a third person.</p>
<p>He is accused of plunging a knife into the back of a 77-year-old woman at about 8:10 a.m. March 1 in Cypress Hills Brooklyn in an unprovoked attack. Last month, he allegedly punched a 20-year-old woman in the head then stabbed her repeatedly in the stomach at a different Brooklyn subway station.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Last weekend at least seven straphangers were assaulted, including a man who narrowly escaped an assailant swinging an ax, according to the New York Post.</p>
<p>The spike in subway violence comes after <u>Mayor Eric Adams</u> launched a program on Feb. 21 to remove the mentally ill and homeless from the transit system and connect them with services.</p>
<p>During a press conference announcing the Subway Safety Plan, he acknowledged that many New Yorkers no longer feel safe on the subway.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"We are going to ensure that fear is not New York’s reality," Adams said.</p>
<p>Attorneys for Dowling and Hodge didn't immediately return requests for comment.<br> </p>
